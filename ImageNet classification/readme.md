## **[EffNet_training.ipynb](https://github.com/Movses1/ADV_ML_Bootcamp/blob/master/ImageNet%20classification/EffNet_training.ipynb)**
Finetunes the EfficientNetB0 model for classification on imagenet. But since the model was pretrained on imagenet the validation scores are not valid.

## **[empty_EffNet_training.ipynb](https://github.com/Movses1/ADV_ML_Bootcamp/blob/master/ImageNet%20classification/empty_EffNet_training.ipynb)**
Trains EfficientNetB0 from scratch. Also image augmentation added.

## **[ImgNet_streaming.ipynb](https://github.com/Movses1/ADV_ML_Bootcamp/blob/master/ImageNet%20classification/ImgNet_streaming.ipynb)**
This version was trained in google colab. It's purpose is to make training faster by using nvidia GPUs and to implement data streaming from drive using generators.
