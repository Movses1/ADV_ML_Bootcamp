## **[EffNet_training.ipynb](https://github.com/Movses1/ADV_ML_Bootcamp/blob/master/ImageNet%20classification/EffNet_training.ipynb)**
finetunes the EfficientNetB0 model for classification on imagenet. But since the model was pretrained on imagenet the validation scores are not valid.

## **[empty_EffNet_training.ipynb](https://github.com/Movses1/ADV_ML_Bootcamp/blob/master/ImageNet%20classification/empty_EffNet_training.ipynb)**
trains EfficientNetB0 from scratch. Also image augmentation added.

## **[ImgNet_streaming.ipynb](https://github.com/Movses1/ADV_ML_Bootcamp/blob/master/ImageNet%20classification/ImgNet_streaming.ipynb)**
this version was trained in google colab. It works by streaming the data from drive because the available ram is limited.
