TF_GradientTape - This contains the same implementation of forward propagation as the regular implementation but the backpropagation is done using gradient tape.

Testing_groud - Here is all the testing of different layers on different datasets.

layers.py - contains all the layers calsses (RNN, Conv2D, Dense, MultiDense) and different activation functions.

model.py - here is the model class that implements the weight initialization, model fiting, prediction. It also contain different loss functions:
mse, binary/categorica cross-entropy, cosine loss.

optimizers.py - contains Adam and AdaGrad optimizers.
